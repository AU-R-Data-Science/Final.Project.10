Source: `https://github.com/AU-R-Data-Science/Final.Project.10`

GitHub repository: `Final.Project.10`

Package: `Final.Project.10`

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

The `Final.Project.10` package in based on the final project assignment of STAT-6210

```{r setup}
library(Final.Project.10)
```

The available functions allow the user to input data sets to fit a logistic regression. The output includes: 1. estimated logistic regression model parameters; 2. initial values of the parameters; 3. confidence intervals for each parameter; 4. fitted logistic regression curves; 5. confusion matrix; 6. six metrics based on default cut-off values (Prevalence, Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, False Discovery Rate and Diagnostic Odds Ratio) and 7. metrics with different cut-off values.

This document shows the usage and output of the functions in `Final.Project.10`, using the `Weekly` dataset from the `ISLR` package and the `mtcars` dataset as examples. The `Weekly` dataset described the weekly percentage returns for the S&P 500 stock index between 1990 and 2010. And the `mtcars` was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973--74 models).

## Data Pre-Processing

The `Weekly` dataset has 1089 observations which contains 9 attributes, where `Lag1`, `Lag2`, `Lag3`, `Lag4`, `Lag5` and `Volume`, can be used as predictor, and `Direction` can be used as response. The `mtcars` has 32 observations which contains 11 attributes, where `mpg`, `dis` and `hp` can be used as predictor, and `vs` can be used as response.

It is important to note that the response values referenced in the functions available in this package need to be in factor format. Therefore, the `vs` variable in `mtcars` should be converted to factor format before calling the function.

```{r}
library(ISLR)
Training.set.1 <- Weekly
Training.set.2 <- mtcars
head(Training.set.1)
head(Training.set.2)
Training.set.2$vs <- as.factor(Training.set.2$vs)
```

## Fitted Logistic curve

To demonstrate the function `logistic_plot()` for plotting logistic curves in packages, this section uses `mtcars` as the dataset, where `mpg`, `dis` and `hp` are used as predictors and `vs` is used as the response. The output of the `logistic_plot()` function is in list format, which contains the logistic regression curves for each predictor. For example, in this example the first element represents the logistic regression curve between `mpg` and `vs`, the second element represents the logistic regression curve between `disp` and `vs`, and the third element represents the logistic regression curve between `hp` and `vs`.

```{r}
logistic_plot(X=Training.set.2[,c("mpg","disp","hp")],Y=Training.set.2[,"vs"])
```
